<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user provided the URL to their parish website and asked for a series of frontend improvements. The work involved:
1.  Adding a new content tile (Veillées de Louange) to the Groupes de Partage page, including detailed text for its modal popup.
2.  Rearranging the layout of the Groupes de Partage page to a 2x3 grid.
3.  Improving the visual design and aesthetics of the modals on the Entraide (Mutual Aid) page.
4.  Changing a specific dark grey color used in the modals to a custom color ().
5.  Fixing a UI issue where the modal's scrollbar was appearing on the outside of the container, breaking the rounded corner aesthetic. The fix was to place the scrollbar inside the content area.
6.  Applying these aesthetic improvements (new color, scrollbar logic) to all modals under the Grandir dans la Foi (Growing in Faith) tab.
7.  Increasing the spacing and line height within the Groupes de Partage modals to improve readability and make the content feel more aerated.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (from ):**
- **P0: CMS Admin:** A dashboard at  for managing news and mass schedules.
- **P1: Content Migration:** Move hardcoded website content to a MongoDB database.

- **P2: Future Features:** Newsletter, AI Chatbot, Photo Galleries.

**User's preferred language**:
The user communicates in **French**. The next agent MUST respond in French only.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application for a parish website built with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Currently, almost all page and modal content is hardcoded directly into the frontend React components (, ). The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was increasing the spacing within the modals for the groupes de partage et de prière section to improve readability, as requested by the user. This involved adjusting Tailwind CSS utility classes (, , ) inside .
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: Y (Visual verification via screenshots)
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool (The change is purely visual; a screenshot is sufficient to confirm the change with the user).
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The work is pending user review.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Finalize all aesthetic improvements across the website's modals.
     - Where to resume: All requested changes have been implemented. The next step is to await the user's feedback on the latest adjustments (increased spacing). If the user approves, this multi-part task can be considered complete.
     - What will be achieved with this? A consistent, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience for all modal dialogs on the site.
     - Status:  USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on something: User feedback.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P0: CMS Admin Panel:** Create a backend and frontend for an admin dashboard () to allow non-technical users to manage website content like news and mass schedules. This is the highest priority next step to address the non-scalable hardcoded content.
-   **P1: Content Migration to MongoDB:** Refactor the frontend to fetch content (for tiles, modals, etc.) from backend API endpoints instead of having it hardcoded. This involves creating the necessary backend models and API routes.
-   **P1: Sacrament Request Forms:** Implement interactive forms for sacrament requests (e.g., baptism, marriage) that send email notifications to the parish staff.

**Future Tasks:**
-   **P2:** Implement a newsletter subscription feature.
-   **P2:** Integrate an AI chatbot to answer common questions from parishioners.
-   **P2:** Create photo galleries.

**Completed work in this session**

- **Layout Adjusted:** The grid for Groupes de Partage was changed to 2 rows of 3 tiles ().
- **UI/UX Overhaul for Modals ():**

    - Standardized the header color to .
    - Fixed the scrollbar behavior to appear inside the modal, preserving the rounded corners on all sides.
    - Applied these aesthetic changes globally to all modals rendered by .
- **Readability Improvement:** Increased vertical spacing and line-height in the Groupes de Partage modals.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None were identified in this session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **React**: Frontend library for building the UI.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for all styling.
-   **Headless UI**: React component library used for the modal () implementation.
-   **Conditional Rendering**: The application heavily relies on conditional rendering within  and  to display the correct content based on the URL path and the clicked tile.
-   **Hardcoded Content**: A key architectural pattern (and technical debt) is the embedding of all website text and structure directly within JSX components.

**key DB schema**
N/A. The application does not currently use the database for page content. All content is hardcoded in the frontend.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : This file was heavily modified to implement all aesthetic and structural changes to the modals, including colors, spacing, scrollbar logic, and the content itself.
-   : This file was modified to add the new Veillées de Louange tile and to adjust the grid layout for that section.
-   : Modified to add the custom color  to the theme.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   **Content Hardcoding:** The entire content system needs a major refactor. All text, lists, and structural data currently residing in  and  should be moved to a database and served via a backend API. This is the goal of the CMS Admin and Content Migration upcoming tasks.

**key api endpoints**
N/A. No backend API endpoints were used or created in this session.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your primary focus will be editing React components.** Almost all content is hardcoded in  (for the tiles) and  (for the modal content). Be prepared to work within large JSX structures.
-   **The user has a keen eye for design.** Pay close attention to requests regarding spacing, colors, and layout. Visual verification with screenshots is crucial.
-   ** is a shared, critical component.** Changes made to this file will affect modals across many different pages. Test accordingly.
-   The logical next step for this project is to begin backend development to eliminate the hardcoded content, as outlined in the PRD. You should confirm this priority with the user.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   The agent referred to a  file, which should be located at .

8.  **Initial Request**: here is my parish website. **Status**: Completed.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: None.
-   **Mocked**: The entire content management system is non-existent; all content is hardcoded as mock data within the frontend components.

**3rd Party Integrations**
None.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: YES (A frontend tester was used once to verify modal functionality).
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO.
-   Test files created: None.
-   Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A. The public-facing website does not require credentials.
